Creative types tend to approach taxes with anxiety and dread. This leads to a predictable cycle of avoidance and procrastination that produces subpar outcomes, which in turn slide into months and years of further avoidance and procrastination. Sound familiar?

Enough Advisory offers tax planning, preparation, and advisory services to help clients file individual and business tax returns. If you are new to self-employment, starting or expanding a creative business, or even just more of a feelings person than a numbers person, we can help break the cycle of avoidance so you can feel more confident that your records, finances, and tax outcomes are going in the right direction.
