Whenever self-employed people interact with the U.S. tax system, they encounter barriers left and right. Most self-employed people don't have a background in finance or accounting. American culture does a flawless job training creative types to approach taxes with anxiety and dread. This leads to a predictable cycle of avoidance and procrastination that produces subpar outcomes, which lead to months and years of additional avoidance and procrastination. Sound familiar?
